The purpose of this repo is to learn how to build an OAUTH2 NodeJS RESTful API. The Beer Locker is simply just a starting point. A MongoDB is currently required to run the API

## Goals
* Use a different database - SQLite or MySql
* Create an HTML defining endpoint and API Usage summary
* Create an interface that will access API.
* Alter API the base application to be used for something completely different.
